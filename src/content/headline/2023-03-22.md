Our source codes are refurbished to use C# 10.

Fixed issues

#15 - Changed HidUsageAndPage.GetHashCode() to avoid generating duplicate hash codes.
#18 - Added net461 to TargetFrameworks. The NuGet package will now contain net461 binary.
#13 - Changed RawInputDigitizerData to hold all RawInputDigitizerContact instances that can be read from RAWHID. This will fix ArgumentException caused by RAWHID containing multiple reports in a time.
